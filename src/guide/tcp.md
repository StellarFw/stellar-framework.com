## Overview

You can also interact with Stellar using a persistent connection through a TCP socket. By default is used the port 5000, but this can be changed setting the `api.config.tcp.port` property. Since this is a persistent connection verbs are used to send commands to the server. The list below shows all available verbs:

- **`quit`**: disconnect from the server (the session is destroyed);
- **`paramAdd`**: save a single variable to your connection
  - Example: `addParam query=something`
- **`paramView`**: returns the details of a single param
  - Example: `paramView query`
- **`paramDelete`**: deletes a single a single param
  - Example: `paramDelete query`
- **`paramsView`**: returns a JSON object of all the params set to this connection
- **`paramsDelete`**: deletes all params set to this session
- **`detailsView`**: show you details about your connection, including about the members currently in that room
- **`roomAdd`**: connect to a room
- **`roomLeave <room>`**:  leave the room you are connected to
- **`roomView <room>`**: show you the room you are connected to, and information about the members currently in that room
- **`say <room,> <message>`**: send a message to a room

> Note: the parameters added in previous calls are fixed to the connection, this means that it is necessary to remove the parameters before calling new verbs.

One of the main advantages of using a TCP connection is the possibility to call several actions simultaneously. Stellar keep a count of the calls, so you can keep the management of the different calls in progress.

## TLS

The TCP server supports encrypted connections via TLS, if desired. For this you need to make some small settings on the server:

```javascript
'use strict'

exports.default = {
  servers: {
    socket: api => {
      secure: true,
      key: fs.readFileSync('certs/server-key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('certs/server-cert.pem')
    }
  }
}
```

The secure connection can be tested using the follow command:

```shell
$ openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:5000
```

Or, you can use another node process:

```javascript
let fs = require('fs')
let tls = require('tls')

let options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('certs/server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('certs/server-cert.pem')
}

let socket = tls.connect(5000, options, () => {
  console.log('cliente', socket.authorized ? 'autorizado' : 'nÃ£o autorizado')
})

socket.setEnconding('utf8')
socket.on('data', data => console.log(data))
```

## JSON

The default way to execute actions on Stellar via a TCP connection is using the verbs available for persistent connections. However, it is possible to use JSON to choose the action to execute and pass a list of parameters. For example, `{"action": "actionName", "params": {"key": "some_value"}}`.
