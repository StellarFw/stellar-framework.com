Stellar is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use.
However, the amount of effort needed to maintain an develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support Stellar development by [pledging on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gil0mendes) or donating on PayPal.

If you run a business and are using Stellar in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Stellar development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained**.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Stellar, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while ðŸ™‚

As of now I am exploring the possibility of working on Stellar part-time - if you are a business that is building core products using Stellar, I am also open to conversations regarding custom sponsorship / consulting arrangements. [Get in touch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gil0mendes).
